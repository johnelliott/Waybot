# [Waybot ðŸ“ˆ](https://waybot.primitivemachine.com)

A web app to monitor sensor data form [Waybot traffic counter](https://github.com/johnelliott/wb-counter). See it live [here](https://waybot.primitivemachine.com).

### About
This app tries to load fast by using small assets, compression and some initial markup and CSS before the react app starts. A service worker caches assets on supported clients.

### Origins
This app started as a way to experiment with node, websockets and chart libraries running  and ran locally with the counter connecting directly to the server process. Later I re-did most of the code to use PouchDB, redux and react on the client and deployed it to a cloud server. This required a serial-http bridgeâ€”[wb-upload](https://github.com/johnelliott/wb-upload)â€”to bring the data to the server.

## Development
- CouchDB is required for local development.
- I used Let's Encrypt for TLS certificates. For local development on mac, add the certificates to the mac keychain app to satisfy the browser security settingsâ€”the green lock in the URL bar.

Check out [faker.sh](https://github.com/johnelliott/wb-web/blob/master/faker.sh) to see what the app might see from a traffic counter. This shows the data the app processes.

## Deployment
Deploy to a snowflake server with [Waybot deploy](https://github.com/johnelliott/wb-deploy).

imagemagick/graphicsmagick for creating assets -> [image-resizer.sh](https://github.com/johnelliott/wb-web/blob/master/image-resizer.sh)
gzip for the compression npm scripts

# Waybot config with Ansible

## Use
Use with ansible 2.0+

No inventory or configuration file is committed. 
Hosts in the example are configured with SSH.

## Examples
Example ansible inventory file `inventory`:
```
[edges]
raspberry-pi

[cloud]
wb-cloud-server
```

Example ansible configuration file `ansible.cfg`:
```
[defaults]
hostfile = inventory
```

Example playbook run for `edges` raspberry pi uploaders:
```bash
ansible-playbook edges.yml --extra-vars='{"api_host":"http://apihost.cool:1337/api","serial_port":"/dev/ttyACM1"}'
```
can also use extra-vars.json file with `--extra-vars=@extra-vars.json` on the command line
